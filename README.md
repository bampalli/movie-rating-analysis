# Movie Rating Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of movie ratings. The primary goal of this project is to explore trends in movie ratings and gain insights into how different factors influence viewer perceptions. The dataset includes various attributes such as movie titles, genres, ratings, release years, and more. The analysis is performed using Python and is presented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Files in the Repository
- **`movie rating analysiss (2).ipynb`** - The Jupyter Notebook containing the entire analysis, data cleaning steps, and visualizations.
- **`Movie-Rating.csv`** - The dataset used for analysis, containing details of movies and their ratings.
